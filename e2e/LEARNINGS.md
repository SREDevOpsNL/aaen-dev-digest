# Learnings — e2e

Browser-suite guidance maintained by
[`engineering-insights`](../.claude/skills/engineering-insights/SKILL.md). Apply
it unless current source contradicts it; then trust the source and add a dated
correction. `scripts/e2e.sh` belongs here; CI and other
cross-package findings belong in [`../LEARNINGS.md`](../LEARNINGS.md).

## What Works

## What Doesn't Work

- **2026-09-17** — Plain `npm test` against a dev DB fails the flows that enter at
  `{BASE}/`: they follow the home redirect to the *first* repo and assume the
  seeded demo repo is the only one. Four of the seven flows do this. Use
  `npm run e2e:hermetic`, which seeds an isolated stack instead. Evidence:
  `e2e/specs/01-app-boot.flow.json`,
  `e2e/specs/02-repo-pulls-detail.flow.json`,
  `e2e/specs/04-pr-findings.flow.json`,
  `e2e/specs/05-pr-diff.flow.json`
